V1.15
  - changed the third point option to something that should look better for large numbers of overlapping points, like in Nick's wage to inflation passthrough graph.

  - when playfair fails to save or fails to render a graph, it will now alert you, with an error message that may or may  not be helpful

  - fixed a bug with loading a graph and rotated text

  - slightly changed the default left-margin variable

  - data parser now ignores trailing carriage returns. Should make it a little more robust to human error when pasting in from excel.

  - disabled no-logo graphs. Use a logo, or else!

  - contextual menus will now appear higher on the screen if they would be truncated by the bottom of your browser window

  - you can now choose 'move to front' in contextual menus to move a data element or path in front of other elements

  - Fixed a bug where loading a graph with multiple trendlines would not load those trendlines into the frontend interface


V1.1
  - Really esoteric text bug that was putting spaces after things where it shouldn't have.

  - When you save, selected text will be unselected, which should prevent situations where you can't un-select text after loading a graph.

  - You can now make small changes to your data without resetting all the variable menus

  - fix to opacity on selected text

  - there is now a text cursor that you can move back and forth with the arrow keys. Everything seems to be working pretty well with it but there are probably bugs, please let me know.

  - slight change to vertical tab style

  - fixed an issue with text nudging on certain text elements

  - added some text boxes that tell you what all you can do on the graphing canvas


V1.05
  - various multi-line text fixes

  - You can now drag callout arrows/lines around the graph

  - various callout fixes

  - fix for floating keys being immobile after load


V1.0 - First Public Release
  - server-side saving and loading!

  - various fixes for multi-line text

  - bug fixes for notes, sources, and no-logo layouts


V0.7
  - UI re-design makes the UI a bit less awful.

  - re-sized logo

  - No logo layout enabled

  - Settings tab enabled. You can do all sorts of crazy things here if you want to be hardcore.

  - line charts with >8 groups will now connect properly

  - Top keys work again and are now positioned in a more aesthetically pleasing way

  - I *think* I finally fixed the last of the trendline bugs but please check your trendlines carefully to make sure they are what they're supposed to be.

  - you can now 'label data' a path just like you can points and bars. The label is *always* the group the line belongs to (the label variable field is ignored) and it appears at the right endpoint of the line.

  - using 'label data' with horizontal bars now makes a lot more sense.

  - when you mouse over a data element now, that element's label will appear on screen while you hover the object - useful for finding a particular line or whatever that you want to apply a permanent label too.

  - When you are editing text you can now press return and get a carriage return. This is great for long annotations. I haven't done a ton of testing of this feature so I'd be curious to know if it behaves strangely in certain situations.

  - source/note fields will now expand the footer of the graph if the text overflows the height of the logo.

  - you can delete callouts and arrows now (no seriously this time you really can)

  - Now supports more of the date formats that I claimed it supported in the first place (thanks Ben)

  - recession shading now supported in Firefox

  - Support for dates in the form '1992q1'


V0.6
  - Fixed a but that made the logo appear blurry.

  - New tools splash screen


V0.5
  - Horizontal barcharts are now available.

  - Stacked barcharts are now available.

  - Fixed a bug that caused problems for axes with ranges <.01


V0.4
  - US recession shading and arbitrary shading can be found in Line/Scatter -> Line/Scatter style. I know, the UI looks terrible. You can only shade on the x-axis (is there a reason you'd want to shade on the y-axis?) To use the default US recession shading, your x-axis *must* be a date data type. For arbitrary shading, you can either specify number intervals (ie [3,4]) or date intervals (ie [01/01/1997,05/01/1997]). It recognizes all the same date formats that the data parser does.


V0.3:
  - You can now choose a custom height and width for you graph. You should generally stick to a width of 745 pixels as this is the width of columns on our website. Height can be anything though. Also of note - reducing the width won't do much for you. We currently lack the ability to flow text around an image, so you can't have a left-aligned graph with text around it. This feature is pretty experimental, see if you can break it maybe?

  - You can now have multiple trend lines on a graph - just press the '+' button to bring up another one. I know the interface is a bit of a mess right now - bear with me. By default they will all be labeled 'Trend Line' but you can right-click to delete these text elements. You can also now have vertical trend-lines by entering '-' as the slope and the desired  x-intercept as the intercept. As with other line elements, you can right-click a trend line  to make it dashed, thicker or thinner, or change the color.

  - You can now delete callouts and arrows you have placed on the graph by right-clicking on them and picking 'delete'.

  - You can now change the visual appearance of points in scatter/line plots. In particular you can now select a smaller, solid point that looks better in time series. You can select this in the line/scatter styles section or by right-clicking on a point and selecting the point style you want.

  - By right-clicking on a scatter point, you can choose to make the point bigger or smaller.

  - By right-clicking on a line in a line plot, you can make that line thicker/thinner.

  - More elements will now recognize when they are being hovered.

  - Fixed a bug where you couldn't eliminate the major y-grids.


V0.2:
  - Date parsing: Playfair can now handle a date data type. The data alert box will inform you that your column has been parsed as a date. Check and make sure! All rows of the column must parse as a date - one missing observation will prevent proper parsing. Only certain formats are recognized as dates. Any of the following should work:

    1981-02-28 (FRED format)
    02-28-1981
    02/28/1981
    02-28-81
    02/28/81
    02/1981
    02-1981
    February 1981
    February 26 1981
    February 26, 1981

  If there are other formats Playfair should recognize, please log these as bugs. It intentionally does not recognize sequences like 1996,1997 as years - either edit out commas in these sequences manually, format them without commas, or format them in your data as 1/1/1996, 1/1/1997, etc.  It also doesn't really handle amounts of time that should be denominated in hours. So if you want to track a stock from 2PM to 2PM the next day, you will want to simply count out the hours (ie your data is 1,2,3,4,...) and then use a custom axis as appropriate. You cannot currently use custom axes with date data.

  - When you hover over a data element on a graph, it will now be highlighted, which should make it easier to right-click on an element and alter its color or etc.

  - When you right-click on a line-chart line, you can now change that line to a dashed line using the contextual menu that appears (or a dashed line to a solid line).

  - Various bug fixes.

  - First beta release
