V0.1:
First beta release

V0.2:
- Date parsing: Playfair can now handle a date data type. The data alert box will inform you
  you that your column has been parsed as a date. Check and make sure! Only certain formats
  are recognized as dates. Any of the following should work:
     02-28-1981
     02/28/1981
     02-28-81
     02/28/81
     02/1981
     02-1981
     1981-02-28 (FRED format)
     February 1981
     February 26 1981
     February 26, 1981

  If there are other formats Playfair should recognize, please log these as bugs. It intentionally
  does not recognize sequences like 1996,1997 as years - either edit out commas in these sequences
  manually or format them without columns.
