V0.4

V0.3:
  - You can now choose a custome height and width for you graph. You should generally stick to a width of 745 pixels as this is the width of columns on our website. Height can be anything though. Also of note - reducing the width won't do much for you. We currently lack the ability to flow text around an image, so you can't have a left-aligned graph with text around it. This feature is pretty experimental, see if you can break it maybe?

  - You can now have multiple trend lines on a graph - just press the '+' button to bring up another one. I know the interface is a bit of a mess right now - bear with me. By default they will all be labeled 'Trend Line' but you can right-click to delete these text elements. You can also now have vertical trend-lines by entering '-' as the slope and the desired  x-intercept as the intercept. As with other line elements, you can right-click a trend line  to make it dashed, thicker or thinner, or change the color.

  - You can now delete callouts and arrows you have placed on the graph by right-clicking on them and picking 'delete'

  - You can now change the visual appearance of points in scatter/line plots. In particular you can now select a smaller, solid point that looks better in time series. You can select this in the line/scatter styles section or by right-clicking on a point and selecting the point style you want.

  - By right-clicking on a scatter point, you can choose to make the point bigger or smaller

  - By right-clicking on a line in a line plot, you can make that line thicker/thinner

  - More elements will now recognize when they are being hovered

  - Fixed a bug where you couldn't eliminate the major y-grids


V0.2:
  - Date parsing: Playfair can now handle a date data type. The data alert box will inform you that your column has been parsed as a date. Check and make sure! All rows of the column must parse as a date - one missing observation will prevent proper parsing. Only certain formats are recognized as dates. Any of the following should work:

       02-28-1981
       02/28/1981
       02-28-81
       02/28/81
       02/1981
       02-1981
       1981-02-28 (FRED format)
       February 1981
       February 26 1981
       February 26, 1981

  If there are other formats Playfair should recognize, please log these as bugs. It intentionally does not recognize sequences like 1996,1997 as years - either edit out commas in these sequences manually, format them without commas, or format them in your data as 1/1/1996, 1/1/1997, etc.  It also doesn't really handle amounts of time that should be denominated in hours. So if you want to track a stock from 2PM to 2PM the next day, you will want to simply count out the hours (ie your data is 1,2,3,4,...) and then use a custom axis as appropriate. You cannot currently use custom axes with date data.

  - When you hover over a data element on a graph, it will now be highlighted, which should make it easier to right-click on an element and alter its color or etc.

  - When you right-click on a line-chart line, you can now change that line to a dashed line using the contextual menu that appears (or a dashed line to a solid line).

  - Various bug fixes
